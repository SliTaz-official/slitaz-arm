SliTaz ARM

SliTaz ARM tools, files and


History
-------
While I was porting SliTaz to ARM I ended by creating a lot of initramfs to
test the SliTaz boot, packages and so on. Si I first wrote a small script,
then improved it so I just have to put include packages in a single directory
and all custom files in a rootfs directory. I also wanted virtual disk
suport so I can code under Qemu and save my work. So this how sat is born,
one we may have use TazLito or a new SliTaz Live tool, but at the time being
sta and the way it work feet all my needs
