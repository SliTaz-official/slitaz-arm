SliTaz ARM tools and files


Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To install 'sat' and 'spi' you must have make installed:

# make install


rootfs/ directory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Custom SliTaz ARM scripts and files used to generate a distro. These files
and any other system files can be erased or added via the flavors support. The
rootfs files can also be directly modified before generating a new distro. 


Sat quickstart
--------------
Sat is a tool in the spirit of all SliTaz tools, all commands and options are
accessible via: sat usage or help. To create a distro you first need to have
some ARM packages. You can use custom cook or the one from the SliTaz mirror.
Put all your custom *.tazpkg in the packages/ directory and sat will install
them. To use the official packages you need to sync the mirror with:

# sat mirror

Generate the distro initramfs with your custom --options:

# sat gen --flavor=base --kmap

To boot the distro with Qemu you can run:

# sat emu


Mirror
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat lets you clone the ARM cooking mirror to let you debug and try official ARM
packages. Sat will create a mirror directory in the working path and download 
all lists and packages. After a first clone it will only check the repo ID 
file and download any modified or new packages.

History
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While I was porting SliTaz to ARM I ended up by creating a lot of initramfs' 
to test the SliTaz boot, packages and so on. So I first wrote a small script,
then improved it by just having to put include packages in a single directory
and all custom files in a rootfs directory. I also wanted virtual disk support
so I can code under Qemu and save my work. This is how sat was born, one day
we may use TazLito or have a new SliTaz Live tool, but for the time being 'sat'
and the way it works fits all my needs to build custom distros and then boot
with qemu-system-arm.
