SliTaz ARM tools, files and


Sat howto
---------
Sat is a tool in the spirit of all SliTaz tools, all commands and options are
accessible via: sat usage or help. To create a distro you first need to have
some ARM packages. You can use custom cook the one from SliTaz mirror, put
them all in a packages/ directory and sat will install them. Then generate the
distro initramfs with your custom --options:

# sat gen

To boot the distro with Qemu you can run:

# sat emu

Sata le you clone the ARM cooking repo to let you debug and try official ARM
packages. Sat will creat a mirror directory in the working path, douwnlod all
list and packages. After a first clone it will only check the repo ID file
and download the modified or new packages.


History
-------
While I was porting SliTaz to ARM I ended by creating a lot of initramfs to
test the SliTaz boot, packages and so on. So I first wrote a small script,
then improved it so just have to put include packages in a single directory
and all custom files in a rootfs directory. I also wanted virtual disk support
so I can code under Qemu and save my work. This is how sat is born, one day
we may use TazLito or have a new SliTaz Live tool, but at the time being 'sat'
and the way it work feet all my needs to buils custom distro and boot then
with qemu-system-arm.
