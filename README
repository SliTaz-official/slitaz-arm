SliTaz ARM tools, files and


Sat howto
---------
Sat is a toll in the spirit of all SliTaz tool, all commands and options are
accessible via the usage or help command. To create a distro you first need
to have some ARM packages. You can use custom cook the one from SliTaz mirror,
put them all in a packages/ directory and sat will install them. Then run
'sat gen' with your custom --options to build an initramfs. To boot the distro
with Qemu you can run: sat emu


History
-------
While I was porting SliTaz to ARM I ended by creating a lot of initramfs to
test the SliTaz boot, packages and so on. So I first wrote a small script,
then improved it so just have to put include packages in a single directory
and all custom files in a rootfs directory. I also wanted virtual disk support
so I can code under Qemu and save my work. This is how sat is born, one day
we may use TazLito or have a new SliTaz Live tool, but at the time being 'sat'
and the way it work feet all my needs to buils custom distro and boot then
with qemu-system-arm.
