SliTaz Raspberry Pi distro tools and files


TazBerry
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SliTaz Raspberry Pi Config Tool with cmdline suport and user frindly ncurses 
interface. Symply run the tool to get the menu or give TazBerry a function in
argument to execute it. Tazberry cmdline output is formated to be used in GUI
tools such as CGI scripts or GTK boxes:

$ tazberry ls-functions


Sat RPi build tool quickstart
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Raspberry Pi has a lot of specifications. SliTaz ARM provides 'sat-rpi' to build
custom SliTaz Rpi distro images ready to boot. A SliTaz RPi prebuilt Linux kernel
package is hosted on the SliTaz mirror. To get the latest version and unpack it:

# sat-rpi get-linux

The 'gen' command will generate a new SliTaz Raspberry Pi distro using 'sat'.
It will also install needed firmware and boot configuration files from the 
directory: flavors/rpi*/rootfs. Don't forget to sync your local packages 
mirror before generating the distro to get the latest versions and fixes:

# sat-rpi gen

Then you can install the distro on the sdcard. It is recommended to use
3 partitions: one for /boot formatted in FAT32, second for the swap memory
and third for the root filesystem. You can you use gparted or 'fdisk' to create
the needed partitions. Main advantages are: more memory for the RPi and 
better security with file permissions. When ready and you know your disk
path (sat-rpi ls-dev) you can install SliTaz RPi with:

# sat-rpi install --dev=/dev/sdX


Sat RPi commands and options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To get the list of commands and options with a short help simply run:

$ sat-rpi

  --turbo: The forced turbo option turns off the dynamic clocks and runs the 
           Raspberry Pi constantly at the highest arm_freq.


Overclocking
------------
To enable overclocking select one of the suggested modes from the list. Choosing 
medium is generally a good starting point without risks:

# sat-rpi oclock
# sat-rpi gen --oclock=medium


SliTaz RPi Kernel
-----------------
To build the Slitaz RPi Linux Kernel, Sat RPi uses a SliTaz prebuilt ARM cross 
toolchain and a small patch to modify the kernel configuration. You can browse
the RPi SliTaz Mirror for preview versions or get the latest toolchain with sat-rpi
and build the kernel:

# sat-rpi get-prebuilt
# sat-rpi cook-linux
